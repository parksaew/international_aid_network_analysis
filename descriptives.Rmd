### Democracy aidflow (1988-2016) as a bilateral network

* In this animation showing the flow of democracy aid over the years, it can be noted that:
  - The volume of democracy aid increased rapidly in the 2000s
  - In the post-9/11 period, we see the emergence of the USA as a major donor and Iraq and Afghanistan as major recipients of democracy aid

### Correlation among variables

Before building a model with the available data, it is a good idea to check the correlation of the data to avoid multicollinearity.

  + Most of the highly correlating variables are as expected (such as the democratization dummy and change in Polity score, since the democratization dummy is based on the Polity score).
