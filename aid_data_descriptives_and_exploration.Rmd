```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               corrplot)
```


## Purpose

This analysis explores the dataset created by "aid_data_cleaning.Rmd" in order to understand the data and plan for an appropriate shiny dashboard to present initial insights from the data in the most efficient way.



### Loading the data

```{r data import}

#importing the final dataset created by "aid_data_cleaning.Rmd"
merged_dyadic <- read.csv("./processed_data/merged_dyadic_analysis_data.csv",
                          stringsAsFactors = F)

```


## Descriptives & Data Exploration

```{r summary stats}

#to show more data in the console
options(max.print=4000)

#just seeing the summary of all variables
summary(merged_dyadic)
  #note that all country level controls are already lagged one year (think about whether to change this or not)
```




```{r correlation}
#corrplot
corr_all_merged <- cor(select(merged_dyadic %>% #cor object to feed into corrplot
                                ungroup(), #ungrouping so that I can remove ccodes
                              -c(ccode1,
                                 ccode2,
                                 r_country,
                                 d_country,
                                 r_region,
                                 d_region,
                                 dyad_id)) %>%
                                select_at(c(vars(-matches("(_(\\d)+|_lag|_log|_corrected|_fd|_sum)$")),
                                          vars(-matches("^(commit_|distw)")))), 
                       use = "pairwise.complete.obs")


corrplot(corr_all_merged,
         type = "upper") #no surprises here

#should un-lag controls for this (or lag everything)

```



```{r trendlines}

#trendlines (dyads as obs, year as x var, each var as y var)



merged_dyadic_plot <- merged_dyadic %>%
  mutate(dyad_name = paste0(d_country, " - ", r_country)) #create human-readable dyad names


```





```{r missing data}


#missing data distribution (amelia)

```



## Plots for dashboard

```{r ggplots}

#first build the individual plots that will go in the dashboard and then combine them into a dashboard
  #1. Map plot (doesn't have to be an exact map, but needs to visually show all countries, and would be useful if they are somewhat in their geographical positions)
    #some resources:
      #https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/hexbin-map.html 
  #2. Top 5 plot/list
  #3. Overall volume trend plot




```
