```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               corrplot)
```


## Purpose

This analysis explores the dataset created by "aid_data_cleaning.Rmd" in order to understand the data and plan for an appropriate shiny dashboard to present initial insights from the data in the most efficient way.



### Loading the data

```{r data import}

#importing the final dataset created by "aid_data_cleaning.Rmd"
merged_dyadic <- read.csv("./processed_data/merged_dyadic_analysis_data.csv",
                          stringsAsFactors = F)

```


## Descriptives

```{r basic descriptives}

#to show more data in the console
options(max.print=4000)

#just seeing the summary of all variables
summary(merged_dyadic)
  #might want to fix:
    #imigration/naturalization prop logs (there are Infs)
  #note that all country level controls are already lagged one year

#corrplot

#trendlines (dyads as obs, year as x var, y as each var)

#missing data distribution (amelia)

```
